# ProgLangs
Programming Languages class: we try different languages (Fortran, Ada, VBasic, etc)

## This repo is a documentation of languages I have used in Programming Languages class for Spring '18, including:

- FORTRAN (3/14/18)
- COBOL (3/21/18)
- ADA
- Lisp (possibly: unconfirmed)
- Made-up Language
- Final Project (probably Haskell)

## I am documenting this
- Over time, I hope to improve how I problem-solve through exposure to different programming languages.
- Perhaps in the future these notes and this experience will inspire me to make a programming language of my own

## Notes

``` 
Fortran comments !
```
``` 
Cobol comments *>
9 - indicates the occurrence of  a digit
X - indicates the occurrence of char from corresponding set
A - indicates the occurrence of alphabet character 
V - indicates position of decimal point in numerica value
